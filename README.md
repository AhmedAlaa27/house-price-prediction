# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is part of a machine learning exercise where I built a model to predict house prices based on various features. The primary goal of this project was to practice data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection techniques.

## Project Structure

- **`House-Price-Prediction.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook containing the code.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.
- **`dataset/`**: Directory containing the dataset (not included in the repository; users should download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shree1992/housedata/data)).

## Steps Involved

- **Data Loading:** Imported the house price dataset into a pandas Data Frame for analysis.
- **Data Exploration:** Explored the dataset to understand distributions, missing values, and feature relationships.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and removed irrelevant features to prepare the data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created and transformed features, encoding categorical variables for model compatibility.
- **Data Splitting:** Split the data into training and testing sets for robust model evaluation.
- **Model Selection:** Tested different machine learning models to find the best fit for the dataset.
- **Model Training:** Trained the selected model and tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics to ensure accurate predictions.
- **Prediction:** Predicted house prices on the test set and compared them with actual values.
- **Conclusion:** Summarized the insights and key findings from the model's performance.
